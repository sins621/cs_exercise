# Warp Development - Junior Fullstack Developer Assignment

This repository contains my submission for the Junior Fullstack Developer position at Warp Development. The role seeks developers proficient in both C# and React. While I was initially under the impression they were primarily seeking React developers at the time, I have approached this assignment using C# despite my limited experience with the language.

## Background

I was recommended for this position by JJ Williams, a current employee at Warp Development. I appreciate the opportunity to showcase my problem-solving abilities and willingness to step outside my comfort zone by tackling this challenge using C#.

## Note

Although my background is not primarily in C#, I am committed to delivering the best possible solution while learning and applying C# principles throughout this exercise.
